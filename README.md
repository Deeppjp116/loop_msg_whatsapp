# Chrome Script Injection

This repository provides a script to automate sending messages in a specific web application. The script prompts the user for a message and the number of times to send it, then automates the process of inputting and sending the message.

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to inject and execute the script in the Chrome console.

### Step 1: Open Developer Tools

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Navigate to the web application where you want to inject the script.
3. Right-click on the webpage and select `Inspect`, or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac) to open the Developer Tools.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Console Tab

1. In the Developer Tools pane, click on the `Console` tab.
2. You should see a console where you can type and execute JavaScript code.

### Step 3: Paste and Execute the Script

1. Copy the entire script provided below:
    ```javascript
    var message = prompt('Enter your message', 'â€Ž');
    var counter = parseInt(prompt('How many Times ?', 10));
    window.InputEvent = window.Event || window.InputEvent;
    var event = new InputEvent('input', { bubbles: true });
    var textbox = document.getElementsByClassName(
      'selectable-text copyable-text x15bjb6t x1n2onr6'
    )[1];
    for (let index = 0; index < counter; index++) {
      textbox.innerHTML = message;
      textbox.dispatchEvent(event);
      document
        .getElementsByClassName(
          'x1c4vz4f x2lah0s xdl72j9 xfect85 x1iy03kw x1lfpgzf'
        )[0]
        .click();
      console.log(index);
    }
    ```
2. Paste the script into the console and press `Enter`.

### Notes

- Ensure that you are on the correct page of the web application where the script needs to be injected.
- The script is designed for a specific web application structure. If the class names or the structure of the web application changes, the script might need to be updated accordingly.
